## Datasets

**WFLW Dataset**

â€‹    [Wider Facial Landmarks in-the-wild (WFLW)](https://wywu.github.io/projects/LAB/WFLW.html) contains 10000 faces (7500 for training and 2500 for testing)  with 98 fully manual annotated landmarks.

## Bug fix
  1. The code for cauculating euler angles prediction loss have been added.  
  2. Fixed the memory leak bug:  
  The code has a flaw that i calculate euler angles ground-truth while training process,so the training speed have slowed down because  some work have to be finished on the cpu ,you should calculate the euler angles in the preprocess code
